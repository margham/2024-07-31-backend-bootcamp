      OOP:

1. What are the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming? Explain each pillar.
Sources: lesson videos; https://stackoverflow.com/tags/encapsulation/info

The four pillars of OOP are:
1) Abstraction
The code for an object describes the framework (aka the basic properties and functionalities) for the object, but not the specific instantiation. For example, 
if you describe a chair you wouldn't describe the color as "orange" or "black," you would simply state that one of the properties of a chair is its color. This
allows you to use the code to create multiple different chairs that all fit into the same class of object (that class being "chair").

2) Encapsulation
Encapsulation describes how accessible the code is to people who want to edit things. Ideally, you shouldn't let someone hard-code anything into your program, 
you should offer an interface of some kind (like the getters and setters) to update parameters and create new instances of the objects you've programmed. The basic
accessibility levels are public, private, and protected. 

3) Inheritance
Inheritance means that objects and classes inherit their parameters from parent classes. According to the StackOverflow wiki, this is the mechanism that allows polymorphism. 
To interpret that, I'd say because child classes and objects inherit from the parent classes, they're able to instantiate unique instances of the abstract
parent class (which has no specific instantiations coded into it). It's like the parent classes are the blueprints and the child classes/objects are the actual creations. 

4) Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the result of abstraction and inheritance; that is, it means that a class can have many different instantiations that all come from that class. 
Examples include unique species of dog, unique types of chairs; unique hands of cards in a card game; etc.


2. What is the relationship between a Class and an Object?
Source: lesson videos

A class is a blueprint you use to create properties and functionality. 
An object is a specific instantiation of a class (aka the thing you build from the blueprint).

      Advanced OOP (skipping this for now, since I only need to complete 2 prompts for this assignment):

3. What are the differences between abstract classes and interfaces? When should you use one over the other?

4. Research the SOLID principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) as introduced by Robert Martin. 
	List the principles, and give a description of each one.

      Exceptions:

5. What is an exception?
Source: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17391071/what-is-an-exception

An exception is anything that interrupts a program when it's running, and causes the program to end. Instead of returning the result
you expected, it will "throw an exception." This will often throw a message into your console
describing what happened and the line where the interruption occurred.

6. What are the differences between checked and unchecked exceptions?
Source: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/checked-vs-unchecked-exceptions-in-java/

A checked exception is something that Java checks before it actually runs the code, aka it has to work within the 
script for Java to allow the compiler to finish running. It usually throws some sort of compilation error. You have to fix 
your code or try some other handling method to even get the code to run. 

An unchecked exception is not checked at compilation time but instead happens as the program tries to run the C++ code
after compilation. An unchecked exception throws an error or runtime exception. One example is a mathematical error, like trying to divide
by zero. It's not "wrong" because the code still works, but it's mathematically wrong so the computer can't handle it.

       Testing:

7. What is unit testing and why is it important?
Sources: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/unit-testing/; 
			 https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/07/04/how-stack-overflow-is-leveling-up-its-unit-testing-game/

Unit testing looks at the smallest functional block of code (usually a method or a function) and checks for any errors in compilation or execution. 
It's important to do unit testing because if your individual units of code aren't functioning the way you intended, then the problems will only compound
as you piece them together into a complete program. Ideally, you'd have a bunch of unit tests and then a smaller amount of integration tests as you move up 
in scale. Unit testing can be a pain to implement at first, but it allows for more efficient programming and debugging in the long term, especially when you 
need to update your code base.

Purpose

    This Research Assignment is meant to go beyond the course curriculum and increase your understanding of relevant topics while exposing you to online resources you'll frequently use on the job. 
    As developers, research is a constant part of our job. 
    A common saying is that 90% of software development is "Googling".  While that is an exaggeration, search engines are highly utilized tools in the software development role.   
    The Java Documentation is a great place to start, and there are so many other great resources!
