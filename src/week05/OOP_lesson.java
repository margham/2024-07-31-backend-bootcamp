	 * DVD Player
	 * Properties
	 * -height
	 * -weight
	 * -model
	 * Functionality:
	 * -play
	 * -ff

	 * -pause

	 * Properties
	 * -movie length
	 * -image

	 * Four Pillars of OOP
	 * 1. Abstraction
	 * -Triangle - we don't need to know all the properties to know
	 * 			   something is a triangle.
	 * -Table - a table is a general form, but for specific details we need 
	 * 			to point to a specific instance of the table (e.g. what color
	 * 			is it?)
	 * 2. Encapsulation - ensures that code isn't changed in a way we don't 
	 * 			   		want it to be changed.
	 * 					- public vs. private functionality - someone may be able to 
	 * 					  use the code without altering it (e.g. driving a car)
	 * 3. Inheritance - allows objects & classes to inherit from parent classes
	 * 
	 * 4. Polymorphism - e.g. animals execute the method 'communicate' in different ways
	 * 				   - a method in a class can take different forms
	 * 
	 * Classes
	 * -how we structure code in OOP
	 * -like a blueprint
	 * 
	 * Objects
	 * -the product developed from the blueprint
